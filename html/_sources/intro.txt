What's Included
---------------

This tutorial covers the Bokeh "high level" interface. It will present
a number of basic exercises to get you started using Bokeh to visualize
your data, as well as some more topical and advanced exercises to show
how to use Bokeh in particular cases.

.. _notincluded:

What's not
----------
Bokeh has many interesting and important features that are outside this scope of this tutorial:

* Matplotlib compatibility
* "Low level" glyph interface that mirrors BokehJS
* Using BokehJS as a standalone javascript library
* Using the Bokeh server, for

  - plot persistence
  - streaming/updating data to visualizations
  - abstract rendering or intelligent downsampling

* sharing/embedding Bokeh plots
* animated plots

Please consult the full documentation at `bokeh.pydata.org <http://bokeh.pydata.org>`_
for details on Bokeh's additional capabilities.

Exercise Notes
--------------
All the exercises in this tutoral have solutions. Please click the "See the solution"
link at the bottom of any exercise to view it. All of the solutions include live plots
that you may view and interact with.

Each exercise is presented as a partial script with portions for you to fill. These are
marked in comments with instructions, such as:
::

    # EXERCISE: finish this line plot, and add more for the other stocks. Each one should
    # have a legend, and its own color.

These lines are highlighted inline in the source in this document. You may also find
a text `.py` file version of the exercise and the location listed at the top of
each exercise.

I tried to include as much relevant information and content as I could for each exercise
but please refer often to the documentation at `bokeh.pydata.org <http://bokeh.pydata.org>`_,
especially the `User's Guide <http://bokeh.pydata.org/user_guide.html>`_.
