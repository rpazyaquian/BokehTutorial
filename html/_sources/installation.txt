Installation
============

This section gives more details about the installation process of Bokeh.

Dependencies
------------

Because the Bokeh client library is mostly concerned with providing a nice
Python interface for generating JSON objects which are then consumed by the
BokehJS library running in the browser, there shouldn't be a *hard* dependency
on any of the standard NumPy/SciPy stack.  It is entirely possible to use Bokeh with
plain Python lists of values.

The Bokeh plot server does take advantage of NumPy, and may have a hard
dependency on several compiled libraries.

Ideally, you should have the following libraries installed:

 * NumPy
 * Flask
 * Redis
 * Requests
 * six
 * gevent
 * gevent-websocket
 * Pandas

These are best obtained via the `Anaconda Python Distribution <http://continuum.io/anaconda>`_,
which was designed to include robust versions of popular libraries for
the Python scientific and data analysis stacks.

.. ::install_conda:

Installing
----------
There are a few different ways to install Bokeh:

using ``conda``
'''''''''''''''
If you are already an Anaconda user, you should be able to run the command:
::

    $ conda install bokeh

This will install the most recent published Bokeh release from the
`Continuum Analytics <http://continuum.io>`_ Anaconda repository, along with all
dependencies.

.. ::pip_install

using ``pip``
'''''''''''''
Bokeh may also be installed using pip:
::
    $ pip install bokeh

which will attempt to download and build bokeh and its dependences from `PyPI <https://pypi.python.org/pypi>`_.

from source
'''''''''''
You can also clone the
`Bokeh Github repository <https://github.com/ContinuumIO/bokeh>`_:
::

    $ git clone https://github.com/ContinuumIO/bokeh
    $ cd bokeh
    $ python setup.py install

The setup.py script will automatically install the pre-built Javascript
for the runtime library, so you do not need Coffeescript
or any Javascript development infrastructure to use Bokeh.

.. _install_windows:

Note for Windows Users
----------------------

If you are using Windows but, for some reason, are not using `Anaconda <http://continuum.io>`_,
then installing `redis <http://redis.io>`_ may be challenging.
We recommend grabbing the binaries from here:
`https://github.com/dmajkic/redis/downloads <https://github.com/dmajkic/redis/downloads>`_.

We would still strongly recommend that Windows users consider installing a
distribution like `Anaconda <http://continuum.io>`_, since it is the most
painless way to obtain the Python scientific/analytic stack.
