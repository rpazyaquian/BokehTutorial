# EXERCISE: output static HTML file

# Create a set of tools to use
TOOLS="pan,wheel_zoom,box_zoom,reset,previewsave"

# EXERCISE: create two Range1d objects to reuse in the plots. Use the [-20, 20]
# for the bounds.

# EXERCISE: Plot all the sets of points on different plots. Use the ranges above
# for x_range and y_range. Set different colors as well. Try setting line_color
# and fill_color instead of just color. You can also set alpha, line_alpha, and
# fill_alpha if you like. Set tools to TOOLS on the first renderer. Change
# the value of the 'marker' parameter, "circle", "square", "triangle", etc. One
# example is given
scatter(x1, y1, size=12, color="red", alpha=0.5,
        x_range=xr, y_range=yr, tools=TOOLS)

# EXERCISE: Try panning and zooming one of the plots with another one visible!
# Set the plot_width and plot_height to smaller if necessary

# EXERCISE: create a new figure

# Lets plot 4000 circles, you can play around with this if you like
N = 4000

# Create a bunch of random points, radii and colors for plotting
x = np.random.random(size=N) * 100
y = np.random.random(size=N) * 100
radii = np.random.random(size=N) * 1.5

    "#%02x%02x%02x" % (r, g, 150) for r, g in zip(np.floor(50+2*x), np.floor(30+2*y))
]

# EXERCISE: use the `circle` renderer to scatter all the circles. Set the
# 'fill_color' to the colors above, the 'line_color' to None, and the 'radius'
# to the radii. Also try setting the fill_alpha to something less than one.
# Use TOOLS from above to set a tools parameter.

# NOTE: since we are passing 'radius' as a parameter, the size of the circles
# is computed in **data** space, not in pixels. If you'd like to specify
# radii in pixels, use: radius_units="screen"
